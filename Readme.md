For players
-------------
A compiled Windows executable can be found at main/Tetris-Clone.exe

This executable can be run anywhere but make sure that it is always in the
same folder as main/files (as that's where any necessary images and sounds are kept).


For developers
----------------
Main program is main/Tetris-Clone.py

Pygame needs to be installed in order for this to be run.

In order for the core modules to be detected, they need to be on the PythonPath.
I believe that by importing the project into Eclipse (see eclipse-project.zip)
this problem can be avoided. I use the Pydev Eclipse plugin for Python development.

This project was actually developed using Mercurial as version control system (see .hg folder).
